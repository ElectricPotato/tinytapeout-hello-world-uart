# TinyTapeout project information

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.

# This will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "Hello World UART"
  description:  "Sends the 'Hello World!' message to a connected serial terminal"
  how_it_works: "Repeatedly transmits 'Hello World!\\n' with a byte length idle gap between repetitions using UART. One start bit, eight data bits, two stop bits, no parity bit. One bit per clock cycle, which means the baud rate is equal to the supplied clock rate."
  how_to_test:  "Supply a clock to 1st input and hold 2nd input high for one clock cycle to reset. Everything in the design happens on the rising edge of the clock. Connect external hardware described below."
  external_hw:  "A UART adapter such as a FT232 board with its RX pin connected to the 1st output and baud rate set to the clock rate supplied to the chip"
